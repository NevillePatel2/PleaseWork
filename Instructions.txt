Students worked with: 
- Devin Roche, Alex Cybyk, Ryan Cunningham

INSTRUCTIONS:

- All necessary pages needed to test requirements can be accessed via the nav bar (based on whose logged in)

- You can log in as BOTH a student and faculty using:
	Username: admin
	Password: password

- If you would like to test functionality further, you can log in with the following accounts:
	
	Students:
	- Username: acybyk20		Password: Password123
	- Username: devinroche13	Password: Password213
	- Username: ryancun99		Password: Password321

	Faculty:
	- Username: ezelljd		Password: Password456
	- Username: mitrimx		Password: Password564
	- Username: dillontw		Password: Password654

- POPULATE AND CLEAR: 
	- When creating a new faculty or student account you can use the populate button to create a new test account
			- You will need to set your own password for the test account

- NOTIFICATIONS ARE TRIGGERED WHEN:
	- When a faculty selects a student in the queue and either notifies them that they are ready to be seen or deletes them from the queue,
		the student will be notified
	- When a student leaves a queue the faculty will be notified
	- When a faculty cancels an office hours slot, all students in the queue will be notified
	- When the dismiss button is hit in the Notification Hub, it will delete that notification from the DB and update the counter in the nav bar

- BUGS: 
	- Faculty cannot select and notify students in a queue consecutively without exiting out of the Manage Office Hours page and going back in
		- When a faculty selects a student from the queue (to either notify next or delete from queue) buttons and lists work correctly until they need to
	  	select a new student from the dropdown list to notify. A new student can only be selected and notified by going out of the page and reloading it.
			- if you have any feedback on how to fix this it would be greatly appreciated
